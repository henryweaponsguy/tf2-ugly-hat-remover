# Ugly hat remover mod for Team Fortress 2

This is a script that creates a modified version of the [no-hats-bgum](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhbgum/) mod using [nhcustom2](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/) that removes some of the uglier cosmetics from the game. Good looking hats are left intact

Use the `config.txt` file to select which cosmetics to remove. More information can be found [here](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/)

### How to run

[Water Waders & Flavorful Baggies Paintless Casual](https://gamebanana.com/mods/472344) - a mod that removes paint regions from Water Waders and Flavorful Baggies so Pyro cannot disguise as the enemy team anymore

[no_unusuals](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/vpk/nhbgum/no_unusuals.vpk) - a mod that removes unusuals. Unfortunately, it does not work on Casual. More information about the mod can be found [here](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhbgum/)
